My name is **Alex Bernard**!

## Go on?
In 2023, graduated from NC State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Since then, I've been broadening my horizons and learning more about web frameworks and other coding languages.

I specialize in Application, Back-End, and Application Development using languages such as Java, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP.
